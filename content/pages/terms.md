Due to unforeseen circumstances in the market, we may decide not to enter any positions on a scheduled day of trading.  Periodically, the Trade Room might be scheduled to be non-operational for a period of time, this may be due to website maintenance or other circumstances.  You understand that no refunds will be issued if You are unable to access the Trade Room, or if it is temporarily unavailable, for any reason.

We may decide to offer other promotions to new members at any time in the future.  These future promotions may, or may not, be offered to existing members.
